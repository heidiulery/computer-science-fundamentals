1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

Stack data structure arranges elements in LIFO priority and queue data structure arranges elements in FIFO priority.

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

They are both a container of objects.

3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

I would use queue data structure for undo because you would start at the end of the word and take off one element from back to front.  I would use stack data structure to redo by adding the elements back from the beginning to the end of the  work.




1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

function reverse(original) {
	var stack = [];
	original.splice('').forEach(letter => {
		stack.push(letter);
	})
}

reverse('Bloc!');

2. Implement the pop method of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure. Since the internal list is not the same as defined in the checkpoint, it may help to rewrite the pseudocode first.





1. Implement the enqueue and dequeue methods defined in the checkpoint inside your own Queue class.
